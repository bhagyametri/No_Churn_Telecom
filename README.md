# No_Churn_Telecom

## Business Case :

1. No-Churn Telecom has been in Europe for over 10 years, but new competitiors are making it tough to keep customers. Even though they have tried loweirng prices, more than 10% of customers are switching to other companies.
2. Now, they are thinking about using machine learning to figure out how to keep xustomers from leaving and stay ahead in the telecom game.

## PROJECT GOAL :

1. Finding out why customers leave.
2. Creating scores to predict who might leave.
3. Using a "CHURN-FLAG" to quickly help and offer deals to customers who might leave.
4. "CHURN-FLAG" is like a simple flag - it's either up for "YES" (might leave) or down for "NO"(probaly staying).
5. It helps business know which customers might leave and need extra attention.
